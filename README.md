# WIP

Fork of SonryP's VitaMote to make the app work on recent Android versions.

The plan is to remove the deprecated components and replace them with up-to-date alternatives.

Fixed issues:

- Crash on startup
- Crash when opening custom mapping settings

To do:

- Fix input method not showing in the list
